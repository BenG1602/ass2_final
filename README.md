## Reflection 

### Approach

My approach for this task was to create a portfolio site for my photography, the requirements of the site was to have a grid layout to show my images, links to Instagram and a purchase or contact button. Through searching the eleventy template achieve and more I found a couple I liked and experimented with. I went through setting up 5 other sites before I found this one by Tanner Dolby which has all the parts I need and is the perfect layout as a basic start. This template had all the essentials needed for a portfolio website with an easy to use and format gallery. 

### Understanding 

I found understanding and using eleventy and its templates a fairly easy process. After looking through the 100s of templates it offers I could see some similarities and from this I could link parts of the websites to certain files and code. With limited knowledge of javascript and nunjucks, I tried to stay away from changing the codes for these parts too much as it could make the project too complicated.  

### Reflection

Now that the project is over, looking back on what I have completed I realised that I now have a larger understanding of the efficiency of using templates and eleventy in creating a website. Using this way of producing a website makes it easy to update, consistent and efficient. With all the HTML and CSS separate from the data, it makes it extremely easy to change the information of the website without affecting the HTML or CSS. Keeping them separate can reduce errors and mistakes, with it being easier to understand, find and interpret. Since the whole website is using one CSS file and HTML template the consistency across pages is a lot better with every page being the same. I think Efficiency is the best aspect of this design method, with it being really simple and quick to get a page running on your own local server.
